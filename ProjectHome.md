**Vim** is one of the most powerful editor cross platforms.

As well, **python** is one of the most powerful script language, which has a wonderful ability for the text processing, network accessing and so on.

Sometimes you maybe find the internal vim script language is not convenient for you to do a task, although it really a good script language in vim internal.

Now, How do you feel if it is possible for you to **program vim with python** ?
  * bind a key to more than one python function
  * manipulate the buffer using python interface
  * split and manage the window using python interface
  * Implemented the tree buffer and list/tab buffer
  * and so on ...

Yes, that is what this package made for.


OK, just try it.
Happy with vim and python.
